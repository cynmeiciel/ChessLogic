# Chess Game in C++

This is a fun project to train my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills and prepare for Miankil - my magical chess game.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `board.cpp` and `board.hpp`: These files contain the implementation of the chess board.
- `game.cpp` and `game.hpp`: These files handle the game logic.
- `handleInput.cpp`: This file handles user input.
- `main.cpp` and `mainloop.cpp`: These files contain the main function and the main game loop.
- `piece/`: This directory contains the implementation of the different chess pieces.
